# ADR-003: Adopt Modular Terraform Structure

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The initial Terraform configuration mixed resource definitions in the root module, making maintenance and scaling difficult.

## Decision
- Move all resource definitions (ECS, ALB, IAM, CloudWatch Events) into dedicated module directories.
- Root `main.tf` now only calls modules and handles outputs.

## Consequences
- Improved maintainability and clarity of infrastructure code.
- Easier to extend and reuse modules for future environments.
