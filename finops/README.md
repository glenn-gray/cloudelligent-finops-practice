# FinOps Practice Kit - Technical Implementation

**Technical Focus**: AWS cost optimization and financial management  
**Delivery Timeline**: 4-6 weeks  
**Key Outcome**: 25-40% cost savings, automated financial controls

Technical implementation guide for comprehensive AWS cost optimization and financial governance.

## Technical Prerequisites
- AWS CLI 2.0+ configured
- Terraform 1.0+
- AWS Cost Explorer access
- Financial management experience

## Quick Start

### Implementation Workflow
```bash
# Apply finops practice to customer
cloudelligent init customer-name --practices finops

# Navigate to implementation
cd customer-implementations/customer-name-infra/finops

# Deploy cost management infrastructure
cloudelligent deploy customer-name
```

**Prerequisites & Setup**: AWS CLI 2.0+, Terraform 1.0+, cost management experience

## Usage

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Cost Visibility (Week 1)
```bash
# Deploy cost monitoring infrastructure
cd iac-templates/terraform/modules/cost-monitoring
terraform apply

# Configure Cost Explorer
aws ce get-cost-and-usage --time-period Start=2025-01-01,End=2025-01-31
```

#### Phase 2: Optimization Setup (Week 2)
```bash
# Set up budget alerts
cd iac-templates/terraform/modules/budget-alerts
terraform apply

# Configure anomaly detection
aws ce create-anomaly-detector --anomaly-detector MonitorArn=<monitor-arn>
```

#### Phase 3: Continuous Optimization (Ongoing)
```bash
# Implement rightsizing recommendations
cd iac-templates/terraform/modules/rightsizing
terraform apply

# Set up automated optimization
./scripts/apply-cost-optimizations.sh
```

## AI Prompts

### Practice Kit-Specific Prompts
Located in [`ai-assist/prompts/amazon-q-prompts.md`](ai-assist/prompts/amazon-q-prompts.md):

- **Cost Analysis**: Automated cost review with optimization opportunity identification and ROI calculations
- **Budget Planning**: Predictive budgeting models with seasonal adjustment and growth forecasting
- **Savings Recommendations**: RI and Savings Plans optimization with commitment analysis
- **Tagging Strategy**: Cost allocation and chargeback model design with automated enforcement
- **Alert Configuration**: Proactive cost monitoring setup with escalation workflows

**Usage Example**:
```bash
# Use Cost Analysis prompt for quarterly review
# Replace [COST_THRESHOLD] with "$50,000 monthly"
# Replace [OPTIMIZATION_GOALS] with "20% cost reduction"
# Replace [CUSTOMER_NAME] with actual customer name
```

### Common AI Prompts
Shared automation prompts available in the main system documentation.

## CI/CD

### Cost Automation Pipelines
- **Daily Cost Reports**: Automated cost analysis and trend reporting
- **Budget Enforcement**: Policy-driven spending controls and approval workflows
- **Optimization Execution**: Automated rightsizing and resource cleanup

### Financial Reporting
- **Executive Dashboards**: Real-time cost visibility for leadership
- **Chargeback Automation**: Automated cost allocation and billing
- **Compliance Reporting**: SOX and audit-ready financial controls

## Customization

### Cost Management Customization
- **Tagging Policies**: Organization-specific cost allocation tags in [`terraform/modules/tagging-policy`](iac-templates/terraform/modules/tagging-policy)
- **Budget Structures**: Department and project-based budget hierarchies
- **Alert Thresholds**: Custom spending alerts and escalation procedures

### Industry-Specific Adaptations
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA-compliant cost reporting with PHI protection
- **Financial Services**: SOX compliance controls and audit trails
- **Government**: FedRAMP cost management and procurement compliance
- **Startups**: Growth-stage cost optimization and scaling strategies

## Security

### Financial Data Security
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access to cost and billing data
- **Data Encryption**: Secure handling of financial information
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging of cost management activities
- **Compliance Controls**: SOX, GDPR, and regulatory requirement adherence

### Cost Governance
- **Spending Policies**: Automated enforcement of financial controls
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-level approval for significant expenditures
- **Risk Management**: Cost anomaly detection and fraud prevention

**Security Best Practices**: Follow AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar guidelines

- **[Budget and Alerting System](docs/architecture/budget-alerting.md)**: Proactive cost monitoring architecture
- **[Optimization Automation](docs/architecture/optimization-automation.md)**: AI-driven cost reduction workflows

### Architecture Decision Records
- **[ADR-001: Cost Allocation Strategy](docs/architecture-decisions/adr-001-cost-allocation.md)**: Tag-based vs account-based cost attribution
- **[ADR-002: Optimization Automation Level](docs/architecture-decisions/adr-002-automation-level.md)**: Manual vs automated cost optimization decisions
- **[ADR-003: Multi-Account Cost Management](docs/architecture-decisions/adr-003-multi-account.md)**: Centralized vs federated cost management approach

## Troubleshooting

### Cost Data Issues
```bash
# Check data freshness and availability
aws ce get-cost-and-usage --time-period Start=$(date -d '2 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d),End=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
aws ce get-usage-forecast --time-period Start=$(date +%Y-%m-%d),End=$(date -d '+30 days' +%Y-%m-%d)
```

### Savings Plans Issues
```bash
# Check recommendations and utilization
aws ce get-savings-plans-purchase-recommendation
aws ce get-savings-plans-utilization --time-period Start=2025-01-01,End=2025-01-31
```

### Tagging Compliance Issues
```bash
# Find untagged resources
aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources --resources-per-page 100
aws config get-compliance-details-by-config-rule --config-rule-name required-tags
```

**Common Issues**: Check AWS service-specific documentation and CloudWatch logs
