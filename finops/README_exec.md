# OpenOps Integration Evaluation - Executive Overview

## Business Value Proposition

**Objective**: Evaluate OpenOps vs Archera for FinOps automation  
**Timeline**: 14 days (July 7-18, 2025)  
**Expected ROI**: 15-30% cost savings  
**Decision Point**: Go/No-Go by July 18, 2025

## Executive Summary

Evaluate OpenOps open-source platform as potential replacement for Archera. Two-week pilot will assess automation capabilities, integration complexity, and cost optimization potential to inform strategic FinOps platform decision.

### Evaluation Criteria

| Metric | OpenOps Target | Archera Baseline |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Cost Reduction** | 15-30% | Current performance |
| **Automation Coverage** | >80% use cases | Manual processes |
| **Integration Complexity** | Medium | Established |
| **Platform Cost** | $0 (open source) | Licensing fees |
