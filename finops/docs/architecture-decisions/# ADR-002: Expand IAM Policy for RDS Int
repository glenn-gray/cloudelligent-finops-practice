# ADR-002: Expand IAM Policy for RDS Integration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
OpenOps workflows now require access to RDS resources for analytics and idle resource detection. The previous IAM policy did not include RDS permissions.

## Decision
- Add RDS permissions (`DescribeDBInstances`, `StopDBInstance`, `StartDBInstance`, `ListTagsForResource`) to the ECS task IAM policy.
- Ensure the IAM role can be used for cross-account access via CloudFormation deployment in customer environments.

## Consequences
- OpenOps can automate RDS resource management and analytics.
- Supports future workflows for idle RDS detection and remediation.
