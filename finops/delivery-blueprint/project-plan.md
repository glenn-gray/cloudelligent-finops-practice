### Critical Path: 14 days
**F1.1 → F1.2 → F1.5 → C2.1 → C2.2 → C2.6 → A3.4 → E4.1 → E4.2**

### Critical Dependencies
1. **IAM Role Setup (F1.1)** - Blocks all AWS integrations
2. **OpenOps Deployment (F1.2)** - Foundation for all automation
3. **Foundation Testing (F1.5)** - Gate to Phase 2
4. **Idle EC2 Implementation (C2.1)** - Highest ROI use case
5. **Core Testing (C2.6)** - Gate to Phase 3
6. **Final Analysis (E4.1)** - Decision input

### Potential Bottlenecks
- **Day 2:** OpenOps deployment complexity
- **Day 5:** EC2 automation testing
- **Day 9:** Bedrock AI integration challenges
- **Day 13:** Comparative analysis depth

## 5. Risk Points and Contingency Planning

### High-Risk Areas

#### Risk 1: OpenOps Deployment Failure (Day 2)
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Impact:** High (2-day delay)
- **Mitigation:** Pre-validate EC2 instance, backup deployment method
- **Contingency:** Use Docker containerized deployment

#### Risk 2: AWS IAM Permission Issues (Day 1-3)
- **Probability:** Medium (25%)
- **Impact:** High (blocks all automation)
- **Mitigation:** Pre-create IAM policies, test in sandbox
- **Contingency:** Escalate to AWS support, use broader permissions temporarily

#### Risk 3: Bedrock AI Integration Complexity (Day 9-10)
- **Probability:** High (40%)
- **Impact:** Medium (Phase 3 delay)
- **Mitigation:** Prepare fallback to basic automation
- **Contingency:** Defer AI features to post-evaluation phase

#### Risk 4: Integration Testing Failures (Days 6, 12)
- **Probability:** Medium (35%)
- **Impact:** Medium (1-day delay per phase)
- **Mitigation:** Daily smoke tests, parallel testing approach
- **Contingency:** Reduce scope to critical use cases only

### Risk Mitigation Matrix
| Risk Level | Response Strategy | Owner | Review Frequency |
|------------|------------------|-------|------------------|
| **Critical** | Immediate escalation, daily monitoring | PM | Daily |
| **High** | Active mitigation, contingency ready | Technical Lead | Every 2 days |
| **Medium** | Monitor and prepare response | Team Lead | Weekly |
| **Low** | Accept and document | Team | End of phase |
